"""
    This program sends a message to a queue on the RabbitMQ server after reading a csv file called tasks.csv.
    Will import the CsvReader class from the csv_reader.py module.
    Will import the time module to use the sleep function to simulate work.
    Pika imports are used to connect to the RabbitMQ server and send messages.
    Sys is used to get the command line arguments.
    Webbrowser is used to open the RabbitMQ Admin site.
    Time is used to add a delay between sending messages.
    Pickle is used to serialize the tuple messages into binary data.

    The code includes an option to open the RabbitMQ Admin site. 
    This code is set to false, but if you want to use it, change the value to True.
    Make tasks harder/longer-running by adding dots at the end of the message.

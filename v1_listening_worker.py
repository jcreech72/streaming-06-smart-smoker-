"""
    This program listens for work messages contiously. 
    Start multiple versions to add more workers.  
    Each row a task and received and acknolwedged invididually.
    Screen shots in Readme.md
    Run this program in a terminal window.
    Multiple producers and a single consumer
For the listener, we need to do the following:
    import pike and sys to connect to the RabbitMQ server and send messages.
    import time to use the sleep function to simulate work.
    import deque to use a double ended queue to store the messages.
